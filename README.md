## About Geit

Geit is a tool developed to aggregate contribution data of developers in a software development group project that uses Git. It is designed for teachers and teaching assistants to asses an entire group project and its individual members in terms of their code contributions behaviour. Click <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kelhaji/geit/master/output_examples/example-fake-project-orginial.png" target="_blank">here</a> to view an example output file generated by the tool.

## Features

- Shows contributions by contribution types (code, documentation, user interface, etc.) for each developer
- Shows issues and merge requests contribution activity
- Heuristically points out developers who are performing below average, above average, or need attention in certain categories
- Shows project files and folders with percentage of contribution for each developer
- Displays overall commit distribution since inception of project
- Supports up to 24 developers per group project (per Git repository)
- GitLab integration

## Requirements

- [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or greater
- [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation
Install the latest version using the following instructions:

```
git clone https://github.com/kelhaji/geit
cd geit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that Geit is currently in alpha and still under development. 

## How to run
You can generate a report by running the following command:
```
python geit.py --gitlab-url <YOUR_GITLAB_URL> --gitlab-api-key <YOUR_API_KEY> --gitlab-project-id <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>

```

You can also specify the output type:
```
python geit.py --gitlab-url <YOUR_GITLAB_URL> --gitlab-api-key <YOUR_API_KEY> --gitlab-project-id <YOUR_PROJECT_ID> --output json

```
The default output type is HTML.


Note that currently only GitLab is supported. GitHub and plain Git support will be introduced later this week.
