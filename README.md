```
python3 geit.py --target-repo /path/to/repo
```

You can also specify the output type:
```
python3 geit.py --target-repo /path/to/repo --output json
```
The default output type is HTML.

**Note for WSL users:** When running the above commands ensure that the target repo was cloned within WSL.

```
python3 geit.py --gitlab-url <YOUR_GITLAB_URL> --gitlab-api-key <YOUR_API_KEY> --gitlab-project-id <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
```
